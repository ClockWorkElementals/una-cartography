Created for the **JAC-Hacks 2024** hackathon.

## Main Challenge:

- Develop something that **leverages AI as a main part of the app.**

## Additional Challenges:

- Develop something that leverages AI for **cybersecurity**
- Develop something that leverages AI for **education**
- ITS Challenge: **WIFI mapper**
- GameRant Challenge: Create an **automated report** that looks at our News Articles on GameRant.com and match it with the official announcement’s timestamp.

## Judging Criteria

Your projects will be evaluated based off the following:

- **Originality**
- **Technical Difficulty**
- **Practicality**
- **Polish**
- **Overall Impact & Use to End Users**
- **Is this a product that could be used by a group**

## Idea:

I want to build a tool to leverage AI in the generation of mind maps, so a user can seamlessly type in a prompt and watch a scaffold generate for them.

**Different use cases:** The tool should be malleable to different wants and needs, for example a Dungeon Master for a DND campaign, or a professor looking to plan out their lesson.

**Nice to have:** It would be nice to take a written paper and break that into a mind map if possible
